Vulnerability Disclosure Program Policy

At Gemini, we welcome contributions from security researchers to help us build and secure the future of money. If you believe you’ve discovered a vulnerability, please submit a PGP-encrypted report to the contact address listed above. Our team will investigate all valid reports and do our best to respond in a timely manner. To ensure all parties' expectations are met, please review the entirety of this policy before submitting a report to Gemini. By making a submission or otherwise participating in this program, you acknowledge your agreement to the terms set forth below.

	Provide the Gemini team with a reasonable amount of time to respond to details outlined in the report, before providing any information to anyone other than Gemini;
	Do not access or modify our data or our users’ data without explicit permission. Only interact with your own accounts or test accounts for security research purposes;
	Do not profit from or allow another party to profit from a vulnerability;
	Do not defraud Gemini or its customers in the process of participating in our program;
	Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services (including denial of service);
	If you inadvertently caused a privacy violation, or accessed, modified or destroyed any user data, you must disclose this in your report; and
	Otherwise comply with all applicable laws.

Safe Harbor Policy

To encourage responsible disclosures, Gemini will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for security research if vulnerability disclosure activities are consistent with this policy and guidelines. We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted in accordance with this policy and the guidelines set forth below to be “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA and applicable anti-hacking laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in scope. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.
Please understand that if your security research involves the networks, systems, information, applications, products, or services of another party (which is not us), that third party may determine whether to pursue its own legal action against you. We cannot and do not authorize security research in the name of other entities. You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.Please submit a report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.
